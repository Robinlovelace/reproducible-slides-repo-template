title: Future-proof transport planning
---

The materials here support a talk at the [Mobile Tartu](https://mobiletartu.ut.ee/) conference 2024.

See the [slides](slides) in the link.

The talk advocates reproducible research with open source software as a strategy for future-proof transport planning.
Practicing what I preach, the slides are fully reproducible.
